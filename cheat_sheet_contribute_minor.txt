Checklist sheet for contributing SMALL CORRECTIONs to a project
that you have already forked and cloned.

If you have a larger change that you wish to to contribute
to the next edition of the project, use another checklist.

When in doubt, do
    git status
to see which branch you are on, and what files have been changed.

1.  Go into the directory for the project.

2.  git checkout master

3.  git pull upstream master

4.  git branch [name_of_new_branch]

5.  git checkout [name_of_new_branch]

6.  Do whatever work you want to do

7.  git add [list of files that you changed]
    git commit -m "Useful commit message"

    It is okay to repeat 6 and 7 several times.

8.  Check your work.
    This might mean building the HTML and looking at the
    parts you changed.

    If something is wrong, go back to step 6.

    Note for Active Calculus:  It is possible that "make html"
    will tell you that the html is up to date (even though it isn't).
    In that case, do "make -B html" to force it to remake the html.

9.  git push origin [name_of_new_branch]

10. Go to your fork of the project on GitHub and submit
    a pull request.

a) Check that you are on your fork on GitHub.  Near the top left part
   of the page it should have

      your_username/the_name_of_the_project

   and under that, in smaller letters, it should say

      forked from  the_owners_name/the_name_of_the_project

b) If you have recently done step 10 above, then on your fork there
   should be a short and wide yellow rectangle partway down the page.
   On the left side of the rectangle should be the name of your branch,
   and on the right side should be a green button labeled

      "Compare & pull request"

   Click that green button.

c) You should now be on a page titled "Open a pull request".

d) Slowly scroll down that page and look at the changes you made.
   If you find something that needs to be changed, hit "back" in
   your browser and go to step 6 above.

e) If everything looks okay, then scroll to the top of the page
   and write a useful message in the big box.

f) Click the green "Create pull request" button to the bottom left
   of the big box.

g) Probably you are done.  But if the owner wants changes before
   accepting your pull request, they will leave a comment and you
   will see that comment in an email.  Repeat steps 6 - 10 to make
   those changes.

   You do not need to make another pull request, because your changes
   will automatically be added to the current pull request.
   (Note: the previous sentence is true as long as your changes are
    on the same branch that made the pull request.)
   However, you do need to leave a comment telling the owner that
   you are done making changes (do that even if you put that information
   in a commit message).  To leave a comment, go to the project under
   the owner's account on GitHub, click on the "Pull requests" tab,
   click on your pull request, and scroll down to the Leave a Comment box.
