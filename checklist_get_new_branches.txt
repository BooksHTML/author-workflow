Checklist to get new edition/feature branches

The author of a book may wish to work on a new feature
of the book, or a new annual edition, without immediately
putting that material into the current version of the book.
To do that, the author will make a branch for that work,
and will expect contributions to go into that branch.

If the author creates a branch after you have forked the
book. then your computer will not know about that new branch.
To remedy that problem, do these steps in your local clone
(assuming "edition" is the name of the new branch):

1. git checkout master

2. git fetch upstream

3. git checkout edition

4. git push origin edition 

5. git checkout master


Now you can contribute to the edition branch, as described in
a separate checklist.
