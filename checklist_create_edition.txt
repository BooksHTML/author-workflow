Checklist for starting the next annual edition

The current version of your project is on the master
branch.  If you find a typo or other small correction,
that change goes into the master branch and then the
master branch is used to update the public faces of the
project.  (By "public face" we mean things like the
HTML and PDF versions.  Whether or not the PTX source
is publicly available is irrelevant to this discussion.)

You are ready to start making the next major version,
but it will be a while until you are ready to put those
changes into the public face.  You will make a long-lived
branch of your project, called "edition".  The edition
branch is where you and others will send pull requests for
the next major version.

Assuming this is the first time you did this, and you do not
already have an edition branch, all you need to do in your
local clone is:

1.  git checkout master

2.  git pull upstream master

3.  git branch edition
    git checkout edition

4.  git push upstream edition

Explanation:

You are creating a new "edition" branch in the usual way,
making sure that you branch off master after master
is up-to date.

Once you have the edition branch, you push it directly to upstream.
This is different than the usual method of pushing to origin and
setting up a pull request, because you want to create the edition
branch in upstream.

When you are ready to make changes to the edition branch,
you will make a new branch off edition, push the new branch
to origin, and then send a pull request.  (Details in another
checklist.)
