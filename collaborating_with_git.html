<h1>The basics of using git to collaboratively write a book</h1>

<p>
You are writing a book and you would like other people
to help.  Or someone else is writing a book and you
would like to give them some help.  Probably you have
heard that it is "easy" to do this: just use git.
But what, exactly, does that mean?
</p>

<p>
Below are checklists to lead you through the process.
Just like for pilots and surgeons, these checklists will
help ensure that you don't forget an important step.
But unlike pilots and surgeons, you can do this without
any training: just find the correct checklist and follow it.
</p>

<p>
The primary audience for this document is someone who
wants to contribute to an existing book.  We assume
the author has already made the book available on GitHub
(https://github.com).
</h2>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>
You will need an account on GitHub.  It is free.
</p>

<p>
You will need a very basic knowledge of Unix-style commands.
(The Unix knowledge you need is:  creating directories, listing files,
directory paths, and moving around the directory tree.  The commands
you may need to use are:  mkdir, cd, ls -lrt, pwd .)
</p>

<p>
You need to be able to edit files with a plain-text editor
(not a word processor, so not Word, WordPad, OpenOffice, etc).
We recommend <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>.
Emacs and vi/vim are good choices, if you already know how to
use them.
</p>


<h2>Terminology</h2>


<p>
It helps to know a small amount of terminology,
but the terminology is not needed for using the checklists.
Feel free to skip down to the 
<a href="#forcontributors">For Contributors</a>
or
<a href="#forauthors">For Authors</a>
section and find the checklist you need.
</p>

<p>
The source files for the book, text files, image files, etc,
go into a <b>repository</b> on GitHub (https://github.com).
Think of a repository as all the files you need for some
specific purpose, in this case a book.  That repository has
an <b>owner</b>, who typically is the main author of the
book.
</p>

<p>
You will need to make a copy of that repository into your
GitHub account, and then make another copy on your personal computer.
That same sentence, using
the proper terminology:  You will <b>fork</b> that repository
into your GitHub account, and then <b>clone</b> it to your
personal computer.
</p>

<p>
You will use a program called <b>git</b> to transfer files and
keep track of all the changes that you and other people have made.
If git is not already on your computer, you will need
to install it.
</p>

<p>
When you are ready to make changes to the files, you will set
up a temporary universe where all of your changes are isolated
from all the other copies of the repository.  That new universe
is called a <b>branch</b>.  The name comes from the idea that
you can keep splitting off new universes, like the branches of
a tree.
</p>

<p>
Once you are done with the work on a branch you will transfer
that branch to your account on GitHub, and then ask the  
owner to incorporate your changes into the official copy of
the book.  That same sentence, in proper git terminology:
once you are done with the work on a branch you will <b>push</b>
the branch to your fork, and then send a
<b>pull request</b> to the owner.
</p>

<p>
The branch you made has served its purpose.  You can delete it
once the owner <b>merges</b> your pull request.  Make a new branch
then next time you want to contribute to that project.
</p>


</h2>For Contributors</h2>

<p>
You want to contribute to a book, and that
book is already in a repository on GitHub.
</p>

<p>First, get a copy of that book onto your local computer.
Only do this once per book.
<a href="https://github.com/BooksHTML/author-workflow/blob/master/checklist_fork.txt">Checklist for forking a repository</a>.
</p>

<p>
Are you making a small correction to the book?  Use the
<a href="https://github.com/BooksHTML/author-workflow/blob/master/checklist_contribute_correction.txt">Checklist for making a correction</a>.
</p>

<p>
Are you contributing material for a future edition of the book?
Use the
<a href="https://github.com/BooksHTML/author-workflow/blob/master/checklist_contribute_edition.txt">Checklist for contributing to the next edition</a>.
</p>


</h2>For Authors</h2>

<p>
Your book is on GitHub, and now you are hoping that other
people will contribute to it.
</p>

<p>
You plan some significant changes to the book, but you don't
want those changes to appear until the next edition of the book.
To create the <q>edition</q> branch of the book, use the
<a href="https://github.com/BooksHTML/author-workflow/blob/master/checklist_create_edition.txt">Checklist for starting the next annual edition</a>.
Note: if someone forked your book prior to your creation of the
edition branch, then they need the
<a href="https://github.com/BooksHTML/author-workflow/blob/master/checklist_get_new_branches.txt">Checklist for getting new branches</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you have a master branch and an edition branch, then
some care is needed to keep them both up-to-date.  For example,
if someone corrects a typo then they should do it on the
master branch.  But you also want to correct that typo in the
edition branch, right?  To do that, see the
<a hret="https://github.com/BooksHTML/author-workflow/blob/master/maintaining_master_and_edition.txt">Checklist for maintaining master and edition</a>.
